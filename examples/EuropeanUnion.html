                    It has an area of 4,475,757 squre km, and an estimated population of over 510 million.
                    The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.
                    EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market,
                    enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture,
                    fisheries, and regional development.Within the Schengen Area<sup>1</sup>, passport controls have been abolished.

                <p class="text">
                    The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC),
                    established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome.
                    The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities, were the Inner Six; Belgium, France, Italy,
                    Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. Over the following decades many new members joined them while at the same
                    time integration of economic, cultural, judicial and so forth would then deepen the relationships distinct European entity.
                    The Communities and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition
                    of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced European citizenship.
                    The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.

                    The EU operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making.
                    EU policy is in general promulgated by EU directives, which are then implemented in the domestic
                    legislation of its member states, and EU regulations, which are immediately enforceable in all member states.

                    The European Commission, the "Guardian of the Treaties" consists of an executive cabinet of public officials,

                    The European Parliament consists of 751 directly elected representatives, forming the EU's lower house of
                    its bicameral legislature. It shares with the Council of the EU equal legislative powers to amend, approve or
                    reject Commission proposals for most areas of EU legislation. Its powers are limited in areas where member states'
                    view sovereignty to be of primary concern (i.e. defence). It elects the Commission's President, must approve the
                    College of Commissioners, and may vote to remove them collectively from office.
