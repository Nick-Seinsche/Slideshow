    <text>
		Star of the West was an American civilian steamship that was launched in 1852 and scuttled by Confederate forces in 1863. 
		In January 1861, the ship was hired by the government of the United States to transport military supplies and reinforcements to 
		the U.S. military garrison of Fort Sumter. Cadets from The Citadel fired upon the ship, effectively the first shots fired in 
		the American Civil War.

			"The ship was later captured by Confederate forces, 
			then used for several purposes including as a hospital ship and a blockade runner, and finally scuttled in defense of Vicksburg in 1863." - Wikipedia

       On January 9, 1861, weeks after South Carolina declared that it had seceded from the United States, 
	   but before other states had done so to form the Confederacy, Star of the West arrived at Charleston 
	   Harbor to resupply Major Robert Anderson's garrison at Fort Sumter. 
	   The ship was fired upon by cadets from The Citadel stationed at the Morris Island battery and was 
	   hit three times by what were effectively the first shots of the American Civil War.
	   Although Star of the West suffered no major damage, her captain, John McGowan, considered it to be 
	   too dangerous to continue and turned about to leave the harbor.
	   The mission was abandoned, and Star of the West headed for her home port of New York Harbor.
